# DemoApp

The purpose of this project is to explore various front-end
 1. Design Patterns,
 2. Architecture Patterns,
 3. Tools, and
 4. Frameworks.

I am more interested in Patterns than I am in Frameworks, so currently this will be more interesting in terms of Patterns.  I do recognize the need to stay relevant in frameworks, so I plan to explore how Angular JS measures up compared to various current alternatives, and make my personal recommendation based on that.

This is readme is not intended to be exhaustive, but simply to illustrate the most prominent.

## Design Patterns
### State Machine
### Command
### Adapter
### Modules

## Architecture Patterns
### MVP

## Frameworks explored
### Angular Js

## Tools
### Build & development

`git clone <path-to-project>`
`cd <path-to-project>`
`npm install`
`bower install`
`grunt serve`

### Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
